# Changelog

## [1.5.5] - 2026-08-17

### Security
- **Data Tools admin page no longer loads third-party scripts from CDNs.** The import diff preview loaded `diff`, `diff2html` (jsDelivr) and a highlight.js theme (cdnjs) at runtime with no integrity check, and the export tab loaded `@textea/json-viewer` the same way. A compromised CDN or a network-level attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the wp-admin origin with the admin session, reading the embedded `current`/`incoming` option snapshots or silently altering the pending import. All four libraries are now bundled under `assets/{js,css}/vendor/` and enqueued server-side via `wp_enqueue_script`/`wp_enqueue_style`. The runtime CDN loaders (`hfDiffLoadScript`, `hfDiffLoadCss`, and the JsonViewer fallback) were removed. When the library is not web-reachable (Bedrock root-vendor installs), the diff preview degrades to a plain side-by-side JSON view and the export viewer to an escaped `<pre>` block; both are built with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`. Addresses audit finding M3.
- **Log filename hash upgraded, based on the WooCommerce 8.9+ algorithm** (`Logging\FileV2\File::generate_hash`, hashing step). The log filename suffix is now `hash_hmac('md5', $file_id, AUTH_SALT)` over the file id (`source-Y-m-d`) instead of `wp_hash($source)` (which hashed only the source). Hashing the file id rotates the unguessable URL suffix with each daily file, and the explicit `AUTH_SALT` key (fallback literal for writes that happen before WordPress loads salts; no current caller runs that early) documents the trust base. Storage stays in the shared stack log directory `uploads/hyperpress-logs/` (also used by HyperPress-Core, by design), with daily rotation, `.htaccess`/`index.html` protection, and append semantics unchanged. Old-named files stop receiving writes naturally on the next daily rotation. Addresses audit finding M2 residual risk; regression tests pin the filename format for both the salt and fallback keys. Date grouping uses server-local `date()`, not WC's `gmdate()`; rotation timing has no security significance.
- **`Registry::saveTermFields()` now verifies the core edit-tags.php screen nonces instead of only checking that `_wpnonce` exists.** Previously the guard was `isset($_POST['_wpnonce'])` — a presence check. The save now verifies what core actually posts: `_wpnonce` against `update-tag_{term_id}` (edit form) and `_wpnonce_add-tag` against the literal `add-tag` action (create form); a nonce that is present but invalid refuses the save. The hooks are also registered with `accepted_args = 3` so the full hook signature reaches the callback. Addresses audit finding L1.
- **`Registry::saveTermFields()` now checks `current_user_can('edit_term', $term_id)` instead of the hardcoded `manage_categories`.** The old fixed capability cut both wrong ways on custom taxonomies: users granted `manage_categories` could edit term meta of taxonomies whose `edit_terms` they should not touch, while roles with per-taxonomy edit rights were denied. The meta-capability check aligns the Registry path with `TermMetaContainer` and resolves per taxonomy through WordPress' `map_meta_cap`. Addresses audit finding L2.
- **Imported option values can now be sanitized through registered fields.** The Data Tools import validates against the `_schema` embedded in the upload, but that schema is self-attested: nothing ties it to the fields the site actually registered, so imported values could store unsanitized content that persisted until the next options-page save. New `hyperfields/import/sanitize_fields` filter: hosts provide a per-option map of field name => `Field`, and matching keys run through `Field::sanitizeValue()` before `update_option()`. Keys without a field and values without a provided map pass through unchanged; the default is unchanged behavior. HyperPress wires its own option group into the seam in its 1.5.5. Addresses audit finding L3.
- **`ExportImportUI::render()` now enforces its capability in-handler.** The export, preview, and confirm branches previously checked nonces only; the submenu registration enforced `manage_options` for `registerPage()` usage, but `render()` is public and documented for manual embedding, so a host wiring it to a low-capability page would get full export/import behind a nonce alone. `render()` (and the page config) accept a `$capability` (default `manage_options`) and fail closed — permission notice, no forms, no POST handling — when the current user lacks it. Addresses audit finding L4.

### Fixed
- **Registry post-meta fields now save.** `savePostFields()` carried full nonce, capability, and autosave checks but was never hooked to `save_post`, so the Registry metabox rendered inputs that never persisted. The handler is wired now; safe alongside `PostMetaContainer` because each path requires its own nonce. Addresses audit finding L6.
- **Term fields now save on term creation.** A pre-existing bug (not a regression of the nonce change): the create form posts its nonce as `_wpnonce_add-tag`, which the old presence check on `_wpnonce` never saw, so term custom fields were silently never saved when a term was created — only on later edits. The corrected create-screen verification restores that path. Quick Edit (inline term editing, `taxinlineeditnonce`) remains unhandled and is documented as such.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **Zero-config subsystem initialization in early-load environments (Bedrock, WP-CLI).** `bootstrap.php` schedules `init()` at `after_setup_theme`, but that scheduling silently no-op'd when the file ran before WordPress' plugin API was available, leaving `Config` and every subsystem (Registry, Assets, TemplateLoader, AuditLogger, CacheInvalidator) uninitialized while classes still autoloaded and looked healthy. Two confirmed failure windows:
  - **HTTP window:** in Bedrock, `wp-config.php` requires `vendor/autoload.php` before `application.php` defines `ABSPATH`. The bootstrap's `ABSPATH` guard returned before the callback was even defined (the "poison pill"); the one-shot Composer `autoload.files` slot was consumed and other copies were dedup-skipped.
  - **WP-CLI window:** WP-CLI pre-defines `ABSPATH`, so the bootstrap passed the guard and defined the callback, but `add_action` was absent (`wp-includes/plugin.php` not loaded yet), so the scheduling line was skipped.
  Fix: the scheduler now runs ABOVE the `ABSPATH` guard. When `add_action` is available it uses the normal path. When `add_action` is absent it writes the registration directly into `$GLOBALS['wp_filter']['after_setup_theme'][0]` in WordPress' preinitialized-hooks raw-array format; core's `WP_Hook::build_preinitialized_hooks` (since WP 4.7, Trac #38929) converts that into a real `WP_Hook` when `plugin.php` loads. The bug was confirmed live on a Bedrock staging server (subsystems dead) and is closed by this change.
- **`!has_action` priority-0 double-registration bug.** `has_action()` returns the priority integer, so for this priority-0 callback it returns `0` (falsy); the old `!has_action(...)` guard was always-true. Now `has_action(...) === false`.
- **Unguarded `add_action` in the autoloader-fallback branch.** The `admin_notices` closure ran unconditionally and would fatal in the early window. Now `function_exists`-guarded with an `error_log` fallback.

### Added
- **`LibraryBootstrap::ensureInitialized()` safety net (Layer 2).** Brings the library up if a consumer touched an early-reachable facade before `after_setup_theme` fired. Wired into `registerOptionsPage`, `registerWPSettingsCompatibilityPage`, `makeOptionPage`, `makeAdminPage`, the post/term/user-meta container factories (`createPostMetaContainer`, `makePostMeta`, `makeTermMeta`, `makeUserMeta`), and `Registry::getInstance()`. Emits `_doing_it_wrong()` when the `init` hook has already fired, because field/options-page registrations added that late will be incomplete. Recursion-safe via the G1 ordering invariant below. Not applied to the pure option read/write helpers (`getOptions`, `getFieldValue`, `setFieldValue`, `deleteFieldOption`) or the value-object factories, which have no Config/Registry reach.
- **Regression tests** for the new behavior: `ensureInitialized` bring-up and no-op (isolated processes), and `Registry::init()` Rule B synchronous register-all.

### Changed
- **G1: election-guard ordering.** `define(__NAMESPACE__ . '\LOADED')` now runs AFTER `Config::markInitialized()` inside `init()`. Previously LOADED was claimed before Config was marked; a mid-init abort would leave LOADED set with Config uninitialized, making every later `ensureInitialized()` a silent no-op. The ordering is load-bearing and documented: `markInitialized()` must precede the internal `Registry::getInstance()` call so the `ensureInitialized()` guard on `getInstance()` cannot recurse.
- **Layer 3: `Registry::init()` register-or-run (Rule B).** If the `init` hook already fired (late bring-up via `ensureInitialized`), `registerAll` now runs synchronously instead of being scheduled onto a hook that will never fire.
- **Subsystem ordering.** `Registry::getInstance()->init()` now runs LAST in `LibraryBootstrap::init()`, after Assets/TemplateLoader/AuditLogger/CacheInvalidator are wired, so a synchronous late `registerAll` (which fires `do_action('hyperfields/register')`) sees those subsystems available.
- **Contract freeze (documented).** The bootstrap callback name (`hyperfields_bootstrap_init`) and the `init()` target (`\HyperFields\LibraryBootstrap::init`) are part of a cross-version contract: a stale copy can win Composer's `autoload.files` race and call into whatever class copy wins the SPL election, so renaming the method in a future major would fatal every request at `after_setup_theme`.

### Internal
- `ensureInitialized` alarm now guards `did_action` with `function_exists` for consistency with the `_doing_it_wrong` guard (the two live in different core files: `plugin.php` and `functions.php`).
- The unreachable `is_array()` false branch in the `wp_filter` preinit write now `error_log`s, so a future regression of that shape cannot fail silent.
- The autoloader-fallback admin-notice closure is now `static` (matches HyperBlocks and HyperPress).

## [1.5.3] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **`LibraryBootstrap::resolveAssetBaseUrl()` — the single source of truth for resolving the library's own asset base URL.** Consolidates three previously duplicated resolution shapes that had drifted apart across seven enqueue sites. Resolution order:
  1. `Config::$pluginUrl` — the normal elected path, set by `LibraryBootstrap::init()`.
  2. `HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL` — HyperPress-Core owns this constant and resolves it from its own base directory; respected when HyperPress is the active host.
  3. `LibraryBootstrap::resolveContentUrl(dirname(__DIR__))` — defense-in-depth fallback for when no bootstrap completed (e.g. `bootstrap.php` was pulled in by Composer's `autoload.files` before `add_action()` existed, so its `after_setup_theme` scheduling silently no-op'd — common when an early drop-in or mu-plugin triggers the host autoloader). Resolves from THIS copy's own root, so the assets that match the loaded classes are the ones that enqueue. Returns `''` for non-web-accessible locations (e.g. a Bedrock root `vendor/` outside the document root); callers bail then.
  - `Config` is **not** mutated: the cross-copy election/bootstrap state stays untouched, so HyperPress-Core's own bootstrap still wins when present. Mirrors the fallback HyperBlocks' editor-asset enqueue already uses against the same gap.

### Changed
- **Every asset-enqueue site now routes through `resolveAssetBaseUrl()` instead of inlining its own resolution.** Removes the three divergent inline shapes:
  - `Config::$pluginUrl !== '' ? Config::$pluginUrl : (defined('HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL') ? HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL : '')` — previously in `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()`, `TemplateLoader::enqueueDeferredAssets()`, and `Admin\ExportImportUI::enqueuePageAssets()`.
  - The full `Config::$pluginUrl` / `plugins_url('', ...)` fallback block — previously duplicated verbatim in `AdminPage`, `OptionsPage` (settings assets), and `OptionsPage` (React app enqueue).
  - The bare `Config::$pluginUrl === ''` early-return in `Assets::enqueueScripts()`, which had no fallback at all.
  All seven sites now share one method, so the new `resolveContentUrl()` fallback tier applies uniformly and the resolution contract can no longer drift between callers.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-09

### Security
- **Save handlers now require a verified form-origin nonce.** Legacy user and term meta save paths that accepted a weaker check now verify the nonce against the form origin, rejecting forged save requests.
- **Posted values are unslashed before validation.** Save handlers now unslash incoming data so sanitization sees the real values, preventing slashed input from slipping past content and length checks.
- **Multiselect fields can be cleared.** A hidden sentinel now lets a multiselect submit an empty selection so a stored value is actually removed, and submitted values are filtered against the allowed option keys.
- **Conditional logic evaluates relation groups correctly.** `AND`/`OR` relations are compiled into boolean groups instead of being flattened, and the `IN`/`NOT IN` operators handle array-valued fields via set intersection.

### Changed
- **Association field queries are bounded.** The primary lookup skips row counting, and the fallback now considers all post statuses so a draft or private association is no longer silently dropped on save.
- Path normalization in `resolveContentUrl()` prefers the native `wp_normalize_path()`.

### Removed
- **Legacy content export/import.** The deprecated `ContentExportImport` and `ContentTransferAdapter` classes and their helpers were removed in favor of the transfer workflow.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
- Dependencies updated.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Automatic cache invalidation on HyperFields saves.** `HyperFields\CacheInvalidator` clears stale transients and resets OPcache whenever HyperFields persists data through its semantic save actions (`hyperfields/options_page/after_save`, `hyperfields/settings/after_save`, the post/term/user `*_meta_container_saved` actions, and `hyperfields/import/after`). Each fires only on a real value change (no-op writes are filtered upstream), so invalidation runs once per actual write, not on every form submit. Wired in by `LibraryBootstrap::init()`.
  - **Transient clearing is backend-aware:** with no external object cache, transients live in `wp_options` and are purged by a direct SQL DELETE of `_transient_*` / `_site_transient_*` (plus the matching sitemeta rows on a multisite main network). With a persistent object cache (Redis/Memcached), transients live ONLY in the cache under the `transient` / `site-transient` groups, so no DB rows exist; they are cleared surgically via `wp_cache_flush_group()` instead. Backends that do not advertise group-flush support (`wp_cache_supports('flush_group')`) are left alone by default.
  - **OPcache reset:** `opcache_reset()` when the extension is available. OPcache caches compiled PHP bytecode, not option values; the reset serves sites that derive PHP/config from options or cache compiled templates keyed off option state.
  - **Filters:** master switch `hyperfields/cache/auto_invalidate` (default `true`) disables everything; `hyperfields/cache/flush_transients` (default `true`) and `hyperfields/cache/reset_opcache` (default `true`) toggle those layers. `hyperfields/cache/flush_object_cache` (default `false`) is an explicit opt-in for a full `wp_cache_flush()`, the documented performance anti-pattern (Trac #63070 wontfix; the redis-cache FAQ warns frequent flushes cause timeouts). Use it only on a persistent backend that lacks group-flush support. `add_filter('hyperfields/cache/auto_invalidate', '__return_false');` turns the feature off entirely.
  - **Manual flush:** `HyperFields\CacheInvalidator::flush()` or the `hf_flush_hyperfields_cache()` helper trigger a flush outside the save lifecycle (wp-cron, migrations, importers), still honoring the per-layer filters.
- `tests/Unit/CacheInvalidatorTest.php`: 12 tests covering action registration, the master filter, the transient backend split (Redis group-flush vs DB purge vs unsupported backend), the full-flush opt-in (default off, opt-in, no-ext-cache skip), and the no-`wpdb` guard.

### Changed
- **WordPress 6.5+ is now the minimum** across the Hyper stack (HyperFields, HyperPress-Core, HyperBlocks, HyperPress plugin). Drops back-compat for older WP. WP 6.5 guarantees modern APIs like `wp_cache_flush_group()` / `wp_cache_supports()` (6.1+), so `CacheInvalidator` needs no `function_exists` guards for cache functions. PHP floor unified at 8.2+.
  - HyperPress plugin (`api-for-htmx`) `readme.txt`: `Requires at least` 6.4 → 6.5, `Requires PHP` 8.1 → 8.2, `Tested up to` 6.6 → 7.0 (plugin header was already 6.5/8.2).
  - HyperFields + HyperBlocks `composer.json`: PHP `>=8.1` → `>=8.2`. HyperFields `AGENTS.md` floor: "WordPress 5.0+" → "6.5+", "PHP 8.1+" → "8.2+".
  - HyperPress-Core was already PHP `>=8.2`; the WP floor is enforced by the consuming plugin header.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Admin asset 404s when HyperFields runs under HyperPress.** `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()` and `ExportImportUI::enqueuePageAssets()` preferred `HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL` over `HYPERFIELDS_PLUGIN_URL` for HyperFields' own assets (`hyperfields-admin.css`, `conditional-fields.js`, `media-fields.js`, `map-field.js`, `hyperfields-admin.js`) — a legacy of the HyperFields/HyperPress split. Those files live under `hyperfields/assets/`, not `hyperpress-core/assets/`, so every request 404'd. Now prefers `HYPERFIELDS_PLUGIN_URL` (and `HYPERFIELDS_VERSION` for cache-busting), falling back to `HYPERPRESS_*` only when HyperFields' own URL is unavailable.

### Changed
- `package.json` version resynced to the library version (had drifted during earlier manual bumps).
- README: added a Jetpack Autoloader note pointing consumers to the direct-require gate.
- `LibraryBootstrap::VERSION` bumped to match the release (stamps the class file for the version-aware shadow predicate). `version-bump.sh` now scans `src/` recursively, so class-level version stamps are updated automatically on future bumps.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **`LibraryBootstrap::VERSION` constant + version-aware shadow predicate.** Closes the `method_exists` blind spot a peer review (Claude Opus) flagged: `method_exists` only catches *absent* methods, not a method present in both versions but with changed behavior. `hyperfields_is_class_shadowed()` now also treats a loaded class whose `VERSION` is older than 1.4.1 (when `resolveContentUrl()`'s stable contract was introduced) as shadowed — catching behavioral drift, not just absence. Classes without the stamp (pre-1.4.4, test stubs) skip the version check and fall through to `method_exists`. Uses `ReflectionClass::hasConstant()` (not `getConstant()` directly) to avoid the PHP 8.5 deprecation for non-existent constants.

### Fixed
- Companion doc mirrors: the "consumers must directly require `automattic/jetpack-autoloader`" guidance (the non-obvious gate that caused a staging outage) now also lives in `estebanforge/hyperblocks` and `estebanforge/hyperpress-core` docs, not only HyperFields'.

### Notes
- `LibraryBootstrap::VERSION` must track the library release version on future bumps (the `version-bump.sh` script does not yet update it).

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Class-shadowing guard extended to the shared procedural wrapper `hyperfields_resolve_content_url()` (in `includes/helpers.php`)** — the chokepoint sibling libraries actually call. 1.4.2 guarded only HyperFields' own bootstrap init call; sibling paths were still vulnerable: HyperPress-Core's bootstrap (`function_exists('hyperfields_resolve_content_url') ? hyperfields_resolve_content_url(...)`) and HyperBlocks' `hyperblocks_resolve_content_url()` both delegate to this wrapper, so a stale bundled `LibraryBootstrap` (< 1.4.1) lacking `resolveContentUrl()` would still fatal through them. The wrapper now runs the same shadow predicate and returns `''` (siblings already treat `''` as the "bail" signal) instead of calling the absent method. The class FQCN is injectable for testing.

### Added
- `tests/Unit/ResolvePluginUrlTest.php`: two regression tests for the wrapper path (`testWrapperDelegatesToFreshClass`, `testWrapperBailsOnStaleClassInsteadOfFataling`). Removing the wrapper guard makes the stale test fatal.

### Notes
- 1.4.2 (the bootstrap-path guard) remains a strict improvement and is safe; 1.4.3 closes the sibling-wrapper hole identified in peer review. Together they cover both external call sites of `LibraryBootstrap::resolveContentUrl()`.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Class-shadowing fatal eliminated: a stale bundled `HyperFields\LibraryBootstrap` lacking `resolveContentUrl()` (added in 1.4.1) no longer crashes the request when a newer init wins the multi-instance version election.** The election guarantees the newest *init* runs but cannot guarantee the newest *class* is loaded — PHP's autoloader stack may resolve the class from an older bundled copy. Previously the newest init then called a method absent on the stale class and the process fatal'd (`Call to undefined method ... resolveContentUrl()`). The call is now guarded: when the shadow signature is detected (class loaded, method absent) the resolver emits a diagnosable `error_log` alarm and falls back to `plugins_url()` instead of crashing. This is the direct fix for a staging-outage class of failure.

### Added
- `hyperfields_resolve_plugin_url(string $plugin_dir, string $plugin_file_path, string $plugin_version, string $class = 'HyperFields\LibraryBootstrap', ?callable $alarm = null): string` — extracts the library URL resolution (formerly inline in `hyperfields_run_initialization_logic()`) into a testable function with the class FQCN and alarm callable injectable.
- `hyperfields_is_class_shadowed(string $class): bool` — pure predicate returning true iff the LibraryBootstrap class is loaded but lacks `resolveContentUrl()`. The alarm trigger logic, unit-testable without `error_log` capture.
- `tests/Unit/ResolvePluginUrlTest.php` — four regression tests pinning the guard: fresh class delegates, stale class falls back + alarms with the correct message, missing class falls back silently, and the predicate detects the stale shape. Removing the guard makes the stale test fatal.

### Notes
- This guard is a safety net, not the root-cause fix. The root cause is that consumers (e.g. any distributable plugin vendoring a Hyper library) pull `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` only transitively via `hyperfields → jetpack`, so Jetpack never adopts them and stays inert. Consumers must *directly* require `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` for Jetpack to generate its manifest and own class identity. See `docs/library-bootstrap.md`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Vendored HyperFields no longer produces a 404ing asset URL, fixing admin/options-page assets and field JS (multiselect-enhanced.js) that silently failed to load when the library was installed outside `WP_PLUGIN_DIR`.** The library URL constant `HYPERFIELDS_PLUGIN_URL` was computed with `plugins_url('', $plugin_file_path)` (in `bootstrap.php` and `LibraryBootstrap::resolve_plugin_url()`). That function resolves correctly only when the file sits directly under `WP_PLUGIN_DIR`: it calls `plugin_basename()`, which strips that one prefix and nothing else. When HyperFields is loaded from anywhere else, `plugin_basename()` returns the full filesystem path with its leading slash stripped, and `plugins_url()` glues it to `WP_PLUGIN_URL`, emitting a URL like `https://host/app/plugins/home/.../src/vendor/estebanforge/hyperfields/` that 404s. Assets enqueued from that URL never load, silently breaking options pages and field enhancements. This hit real Bedrock deployments where the app's root `composer.json` pulls a plugin that requires `estebanforge/hyperblocks` (which itself requires `estebanforge/hyperfields`) into `public_html/src/vendor` (outside the `src/web` document root), and that root copy won HyperFields' multi-instance highest-version election, so its (unreachable) assets were the ones enqueued. The new resolver matches the library directory against every web-accessible WordPress content root (`WP_PLUGIN_DIR`/`WP_PLUGIN_URL`, `WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR`/`WPMU_PLUGIN_URL`, `WP_CONTENT_DIR`/`WP_CONTENT_URL`, and the active theme template + stylesheet dirs) on a directory boundary, with `realpath` canonicalization so symlinked plugin dirs (wp-env, Lando, some Bedrock setups) still match. Returns the correct public URL, or an empty string when the path is genuinely not HTTP-reachable.
- **`HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL` no longer inherits a broken HyperFields value.** `LibraryBootstrap::init()` previously defined `HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL` by copying `HYPERFIELDS_PLUGIN_URL`. When HyperFields' URL was the 404ing value above, that pollution silently broke HyperPress-Core's frontend script enqueue too. HyperFields no longer defines `HYPERPRESS_PLUGIN_URL` at all. HyperPress-Core owns that constant and resolves it from its own base directory (HyperPress vendors HyperFields, so it may live at a different path). A naive "resolve independently from HyperFields' $base_dir" was considered but rejected: that $base_dir is HyperFields' dir, not HyperPress-Core's, so it would still produce the wrong URL. Removing the fallback lets HyperPress-Core's own (correct) bootstrap win.

### Added
- `LibraryBootstrap::resolveContentUrl(string $path): string` public static method — the canonical content-aware URL resolver shared across the HyperFields / HyperBlocks / HyperPress-Core library family. Matches an absolute filesystem path against web-accessible WordPress content roots with directory-boundary prefix matching and `realpath` canonicalization; returns `''` when no root contains the path.
- `hyperfields_resolve_content_url(string $path): string` procedural wrapper in `includes/helpers.php`, exposed so sibling libraries (HyperBlocks, HyperPress-Core) delegate to this single implementation when HyperFields is present rather than carrying their own copy.
- `tests/Unit/ResolveContentUrlTest.php` covering nested plugin-vendor resolution, exact-root match, the shared-prefix boundary guard, the Bedrock-root-vendor (non-web-accessible) empty case, and backslash normalization.
- `WP_PLUGIN_URL`/`WP_CONTENT_URL` constants in the test bootstrap so the resolver's production code path is exercised (previously only `WP_*_DIR` was defined, so the URL pairs were skipped and the resolver could not be tested meaningfully).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- **Admin CSS realigned with current WordPress checkbox/heading UI** — three scoping fixes in `assets/css/hyperfields-admin.css`, all in service of matching recent WP core rendering rather than fighting it:
  - Section headings now use the admin text-color token (`var(--hf-color-admin-text)`) instead of the generic frontend text token (`var(--hf-color-text)`), so headings match the surrounding WP admin chrome.
  - Removed the fixed `width: 18px` / `height: 18px` on `.hyperpress-field-input-wrapper input[type="checkbox"]` and `[type="radio"]`. WordPress 6.9+/7.x renders checkboxes via `appearance: none` with an internally-positioned checkmark; forcing a fixed size distorted that internal positioning and produced an off-center check, especially on mobile. Width/height is now left unset so WP core owns the checkbox appearance; `cursor: pointer` is retained.
  - Scoped the `.hyperpress-heading-label` rule to `.hyperpress-options-wrap .hyperpress-heading-label`, preventing it from leaking out and overriding unrelated heading markup on pages that share the class name.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Empty image-field preview rendered as a tiny white box** — the PHP image-field templates always emitted the `.hyperpress-image-preview` shell (padding + white background + border) but only placed an `<img>` inside when a value existed. With no selection the styled shell collapsed to a small empty square. Both rendering paths now show an empty-state placeholder.
  - `src/templates/field-image.php` (primary path resolved by `TemplateLoader::getTemplateFile()`) and `src/templates/field-input.php` (legacy `image` switch case, reachable via the `hyperfields/template` filter) now render `<span class="hyperpress-image-placeholder">No image selected</span>` and add an `is-empty` class to the preview div when `$value` is empty.
  - `assets/js/media-fields.js` keeps the placeholder in sync: `updateSinglePreview()` drops `is-empty` when an image is chosen; `clearSingle()` restores the placeholder span + `is-empty` class instead of leaving an empty hidden div (image branch only; file branch unchanged).
  - New `.hyperpress-image-preview.is-empty` CSS rule renders a 150×150 dashed-border box with muted placeholder text, matching the populated dimensions so selecting/removing causes no layout shift.
  - `'noImage' => __('No image selected', 'api-for-htmx')` added to the admin `hyperpressFields.l10n` array in `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()` so the JS-restored placeholder is translatable.
- **VIP/WPCS `EscapeOutput` compliance for the `is-empty` class output** — both template `echo` sites now wrap the class literal in `esc_attr()` as defense-in-depth, even though the output is a hardcoded literal.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **`wp.media` handler for image, file, and `media_gallery` fields** — the PHP field templates emitted `.hyperpress-upload-button` / `.hyperpress-remove-button` markup but no JavaScript existed to open the media frame. Only the React path (`react-fields.js` / `ImageField.jsx`) had a working picker; consumers on the plain PHP-template path got dead buttons. New dedicated `assets/js/media-fields.js` (ES6 `class HyperFieldsMedia`, singleton-scoped, event-delegated):
  - Single-select frame for `image` (stores attachment ID) and `file` (stores URL), with live preview updates and remove-button visibility toggling.
  - Multi-select frame for `media_gallery` (stores comma-joined IDs), with per-item thumbnail fetch via `wp.media.attachment().fetch()` and per-item removal.
  - Reads the existing `hyperpressFields.l10n` strings; no new localization surface.
  - Degrades gracefully: returns early when `wp.media` is undefined.
- **`wp_enqueue_media()` call in `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()`** for admin pages, so the core media scripts load alongside the new handler. Guarded with `function_exists()` (progressive enhancement; the hidden input still submits its value without it).

### Fixed
- **Double-enqueue of `conditional-fields.js`** — `Assets::enqueueScripts()` registered the script under handle `hyperfields-conditional-fields` while `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()` used `hyperpress-conditional-fields`. Same file, two handles, so the script (and its `hyperpressFields` localization) loaded twice on every admin page. Removed the redundant enqueue from `Assets.php`; `TemplateLoader` is now the single source.
- **Flat-layout fields rendered unstyled** — field templates use two layouts: grid-row (number/text/checkbox/textarea/select) and flat (radio/image/file/separator/heading/html). The flat layout emitted classes with zero CSS rules, so radio groups, image pickers, separators, and headings rendered as raw, unstyled HTML. A `:has(> .hyperpress-field-label)` rule now aligns flat fields to the same 220px label/input grid as the grid-row fields (scoped to flat fields only). Native WP-style rules added for `.hyperpress-radio-vertical`/`-horizontal`, `.hyperpress-image-field`/`-file-field`/`-media-gallery-field` (CSS grid: buttons side by side on row 1, preview wraps below and hugs the image), `.hyperpress-separator`, `.hyperpress-heading-wrapper`, `.hyperpress-html-content`. Mobile: flat fields collapse to a single column under 782px, matching the existing grid-row collapse.

### Docs
- **Jetpack Autoloader guidance** in `docs/library-bootstrap.md`. Host plugins using `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` must explicitly `require_once` the bootstrap file and call `hyperfields_run_initialization_logic()`, because the Jetpack Autoloader skips Composer autoload `files` entries. Without it, `HYPERFIELDS_PLUGIN_URL` is never defined, `TemplateLoader::enqueueAssets()` bails at its empty-URL guard, and the options page renders with zero styling.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Numeric range enforcement for `number` fields** — revived the dead `Field::$min`/`$max` properties (widened `?int` → `?float`) and wired them end-to-end. `setMin(1.0)->setMax(7.0)->setStep(0.1)` now (a) renders `min`/`max`/`step` as HTML attributes on the input, (b) **clamps the sanitized value server-side** to `[min, max]` so saves can never persist out-of-range data, and (c) reports correct numeric validity via `validateValue()`. Out-of-range values are coerced, never rejected, so the save flow cannot fail on range alone. This is a strict improvement on Carbon Fields, which only emits the HTML attributes and trusts the browser.
- **Type-aware `setValidation(['min'..'max'])`** — for `number` fields, `min`/`max` are now numeric bounds; for string fields they stay string-length bounds (backward compatible). Removes the dual-meaning confusion that made `min`/`max` unsafe for numbers.

### Fixed
- **Container save path bypassed validation** — `PostMetaContainer`, `TermMetaContainer`, and `UserMetaContainer` called `sanitizeValue()` but never `validateValue()`, so `wps_validate` and `setValidation` rules were silently ignored for post/term/user meta. Each save loop now runs validation and skips fields that fail (existing meta preserved). Numeric range never triggers a skip because the sanitizer clamps first.
- **`ReactField::getMin`/`getMax` LSP break** — signatures widened from `?int` to `?float` to match the parent after the `Field` property change. (Note: the bodies still read `toArray()['min']`, which never exists — pre-existing dead code that always returns `null`; the parent getters now take precedence via the property. Tracked for a separate cleanup.)

### Tests
- `FieldTest::testNumberRangeClampAndAttributes` — covers clamp behavior (below-min, above-max, in-range, non-numeric), float getters, `step` independence, HTML attribute injection into `toArray()`, user-attribute precedence, and non-number field isolation.
- `FieldTest::testValidationRulesAreTypeAware` — covers numeric `min`/`max` for `number` vs string-length `min`/`max` for `text`.
- `UserMetaContainerTest::testSaveWrapper` — updated to mock the new `validateValue()` save contract.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Semantic save action on `OptionsPage`** — re-emits WP's Settings-API save as `hyperfields/options_page/after_save` so consumers hook intent, not raw `update_option_{$name}` plumbing. Gated on `$old !== $new`, so `after_save` fires exactly once per real value change, not on every form submit. Argument order is `(new, old, page)` (intentional reversal of WP's `(old, new, option)`) to match "the current state after save" intent. Mirrors Carbon Fields' `theme_options_container_saved` surface for migration-friendliness.
- **`hyperfields/options_page/pre_save` filter** — let third parties alter sanitized values before WP writes them. Receives `(output, pre_save_snapshot, OptionsPage_instance)`. Filter consumers must treat the `OptionsPage` argument as read-only; mutating it mid-sanitize (e.g. re-calling `registerSettings()`) has undefined behavior.

### Tests
- `OptionsPageTest` covers `onOptionSaved` no-op gating (identical `$old`/`$new` does not fire `after_save`), the `(new, old, page)` arg order, and the `pre_save` filter seam being applied during sanitize.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **New `AdminPage` class** — non-form admin page host for tool/wizard pages (sticky white header with H1, URL-based nav tabs, notice relocation) without the settings-form machinery (`OptionsPage` is still the right choice for settings forms). Additive and fully backward-compatible.
  - `HyperFields::makeAdminPage($title, $slug)` factory.
  - `addTab($id, $title, callable $render)`, `setParentSlug()`, `setMenuTitle()`, `setCapability()`, `setPosition()`, `setFooterContent()`.
  - Tabs render always once at least one is added; active tab read from `?tab=` (defaults to the first). No `<form>`, no `register_setting`, no Save button, no sanitize callback.
  - Emits the same DOM anchors as `OptionsPage` (`.hyperpress-options-wrap`, `[data-hyperpress-sticky-header]`, `#hyperpress-layout__notice-catcher`), so the sticky-header and notice-relocation JS work unchanged.
- **Mobile nav-tab dropdown morph** — on viewports `<= 782px`, URL-based nav tabs (used by both `OptionsPage` and `AdminPage`) render as a `<select>` dropdown built from the existing `<a>` links (single source of truth). Active tab is preselected; changing the dropdown navigates to the tab URL. Vanilla JS, show/hide driven purely by CSS.

### Fixed
- **`TabsField` layout regression** — `.hyperpress-tabs-wrapper { display: flex }` laid the tab nav and content side by side. Now `display: block`; the inner `.nav-tab-wrapper` keeps its flex row.
- **Sticky-header horizontal scrollbar** — the white-bar bleed pseudo-elements pushed past the viewport on the right. Bleed is now asymmetric: left fills `#wpcontent`'s left padding, right syncs to the new `--hf-content-inset-right` variable so content gets breathing room without the white bar falling short.
- **Mobile sticky-header gaps** — at `max-width: 782px` the bleed now matches the wrap's own mobile padding (`--hf-header-bleed-x: 16px`), so the white header fills edge-to-edge on small screens.
- **Notice relocation on `AdminPage`** — the notice-hiding inline style (`.wrap.hyperpress-options-wrap > .notice`) kept relocated notices invisible on non-form pages because the catcher had no isolating parent (OptionsPage gets this for free from its `<form>`). The catcher is now wrapped in `.hyperpress-notice-region`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `ExportImport` class: export WordPress option groups to JSON and import with prefix filtering, whitelist enforcement, automatic backup transients, and additive merge
- `ExportImportUI` class: admin submenu page for visual Export / Import with jsondiffpatch diff preview
- `ExportImportUI::registerPage()` — single-call public API for third-party plugins to register the Data Tools page; hooks asset enqueueing to `admin_enqueue_scripts` automatically

### Fixed
- `TypeError` in prefix filter arrow functions when option arrays have integer keys — keys now explicitly cast to string before `strpos`
- `importOptions()` returned `success: true` when whitelist or prefix filtering blocked every incoming entry — now returns `success: false` with a descriptive message
- `restoreBackup()` did not delete the backup transient when `update_option` returned `false` because the stored value was identical to the current value — unchanged-value case now correctly detected and transient cleaned up
- XSS via `</script>` injection in diff preview data island — `wp_json_encode` now uses `JSON_HEX_TAG | JSON_HEX_AMP` flags
- File upload handler did not check `$_FILES['import_file']['error'] !== UPLOAD_ERR_OK` before calling `is_uploaded_file`, allowing error-state uploads to proceed
- Non-array option values silently coerced to `[]` during export — they are now skipped entirely, matching the additive-import contract
- `wp_json_encode` returning `false` on unencodable data caused `exportOptions` to return an empty string — fallback is now `'{}'`
- Asset enqueueing (`wp_enqueue_style` / `wp_enqueue_script`) was called inside an `ob_start()` output buffer in `render()`, which fires too late for WordPress header output — moved to `admin_enqueue_scripts` hook
- Options-page registration and sanitization for compatibility tabs with multiple sections now process the active renderable section set rather than assuming section ID equals tab ID
- Options section slug generation now falls back safely when WordPress `sanitize_title()` is unavailable (test/library context)
- Field templates (`input`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `multiselect`, `custom`) now correctly honor `input_class` / `label_class` and support HTML help rendering with `help_is_html`
- Custom field fallback markup now uses `name_attr` to preserve correct options-array field naming
- Compatibility field save flow now supports nested `option_path` values and inline per-field validation feedback without breaking standard options-page behavior
